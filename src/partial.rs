/// The `PartialTreeView` module provides immutable views and operations on subsets of Merkle trees.
/// This allows for efficient proof generation, verification, and tree traversal without requiring
/// the entire tree structure to be loaded into memory.
///
/// ## Overview
///
/// A `PartialTree` acts as a non-mutable reference to a subset of a Merkle tree, enabling:
/// - Efficient proof generation for specific leaves
/// - Verification of Merkle proofs without the full tree
/// - Memory-efficient operations on large trees
/// - Safe concurrent access to tree data
///
/// ## Key Concepts
///
/// ### Partial Views
/// A partial tree contains only the nodes necessary for specific operations, such as:
/// - **Proof paths**: The minimal set of nodes needed to prove inclusion of specific leaves
/// - **Subtrees**: Complete subtrees rooted at specific internal nodes
/// - **Sparse representation**: Only populated nodes in a potentially large tree structure
///
