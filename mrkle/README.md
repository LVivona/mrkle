A fast and flexible Merkle Tree library for Rust, providing efficient construction of Merkle Trees, verification of Merkle Proofs for single and multiple elements, and generic support for any hashable data type.

### Installation

### Cargo

You can add mrkle to your cargo by using `cargo add`:

```bash
cargo add mrkle
```

### Pip

You can install mrkle via the pip manager:

```bash
pip install mrkle
#or
pipx install mrkle
```

### From source

For the sources, you need Rust

```bash
# Install Rust
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
# Make sure it's up to date and using stable channel
rustup update
git clone https://github.com/LVivona/mrkle
cd mrkle/bindings/python
pip install setuptools_rust maturin
# install
pip install -e .
```

### What is a Merkle Tree?
A Merkle Tree is a tree data structure. where it contains a set of properties such as:

- Each leaf node contains the hash of a data block
- Each non-leaf node contains the hash of its child nodes
- The root hash represents a cryptographic fingerprint of all the data in the tree

This data structure enables efficient and secure verification that a data element is part of a larger dataset without needing to download the entire dataset.

### Use Cases

* Blockchain & Cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies use Merkle Trees to efficiently verify transactions
* Distributed Systems: Verify data integrity across distributed networks
* File Systems: Git uses Merkle Trees to track changes and verify repository integrity
* Database Verification: Ensure data hasn't been tampered with
* Peer-to-Peer Networks: Verify chunks of data in distributed file sharing


### Example

```python
import torch
from mrkle import MrkleTree

def namespaced_state_dict(model: torch.nn.Module) -> dict[str, torch.Tensor]:
    """
    Returns a state_dict with the model name prefixed to every key.
    """
    sd = model.state_dict()
    return {f"{model.__class__.__name__.lower()}.{k}": v.detach().cpu().numpy() for k, v in sd.items()}

class ToyModel(torch.nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, in_feature: int, out_feature: int):
        super().__init__()
        self.ln = torch.nn.Linear(in_feature, out_feature)
        self.output = torch.nn.Linear(out_feature, 1)

    def forward(self, x: torch.Tensor):
        x = self.ln(x)
        logits = self.output(torch.tanh(x))
        return logits, torch.sigmoid(x)

# Create model + state dict
model = ToyModel(10, 10)
state_dict = namespaced_state_dict(model)

# Construct Merkle tree over model parameters
tree = MrkleTree.from_dict(state_dict, name="sha256", fmt="flatten")

# Root hash identifies the entire model uniquely
print(tree.root())
```

Construct a basic binary Merkle Tree by chunking data into byte slices:

```rust
use mrkle::MrkleTree;
use sha2::Sha256;

// Input data (could also be read from a file)
let data = b"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. \
                 This is some extra data to make it larger. \
                 Merkle trees are cool!";

// Split into fixed-size chunks
let chunk_size = 16;
let chunks: Vec<&[u8]> = data.chunks(chunk_size).collect();

// Build the Merkle tree from chunks
let tree = MrkleTree::<&[u8], Sha256>::from(chunks);

// Get the Merkle root
let root = tree.root();
```

## Overview

This project began as an exploration of its parent framework, focusing on how to validate and communicate deep neural network models efficiently across the web within a decentralized exchange. The motivation for this work, and its general concept, draws inspiration from early software piracy distribution systems and version control models such as Git, both of which use Merkle Trees to validate ordered structures (e.g., file systems, audio, and video data).

Building on that idea, and unsatisfied with the constant writing to my hard disk of subsets of weights that remained unchanged from the previous epoch, I made the simple assumption that the same logic could be applied to deep neural network modules. Like file systems and other ordered data, these modules can be formulated as partially ordered sets. This ordering is unique to each modelâ€™s layout, and in this sense, the ordered set is bounded by the initialization defined within the module, consistent across multiple ML frameworks such as PyTorch, TensorFlow, and mlx.

Although still in its early stages, this project aims to help standardize data structures within an open library, potentially providing a foundation that others may find valuable for their own work.
